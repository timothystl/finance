// append a path to) — the daycare app's actual implementation is a Supabase Edge Function

// daily enrolled, billed revenue, labor cost, waitlist count — see DAYCARE_API.md in the design
// handoff). It does not exist in the daycare app yet; until it is built and the secret is set,
// `rooms` is simply absent from the client and the report degrades to its category-by-year table.
