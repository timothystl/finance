// The Chart of Accounts presentation settings the legacy Budget Planner builds its Board view from
// (finBuildBoardTree in src/frontend/js-finance.js): each account's saved board category, the
// category heading renames, the "Donor Income" wrapper title, leaf display names, and the purpose
// tag list with its assignments. These are the two finance_settings stores Chart of Accounts
// edits (readPlanningBoardCategories / readPurposeTags); Finance lays out its Budget builder and
// Chart of Accounts editor from them, applying legacy's name-based default to any account with no
// saved category. Structural only: names and paths, no dollar figure. Writes stay on the existing
// finance-board-categories-write-v1 / finance-purpose-tags-write-v1 contracts.
